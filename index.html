      Salaar: Part 1 – Ceasefire is a massive, action-packed spectacle praised
      for its grand scale, stunning visuals, and powerful performances by
      Prabhas and Prithviraj Sukumaran, delivering intense action and heroism
      reminiscent of Prashanth Neel's KGF. While audiences love the thrilling,
      larger-than-life experience and the portrayal of intense friendship and
      loyalty in the violent world of Khansaar, some critics found the first
      half slow, the narrative convoluted, and the pacing uneven, though the
      second half's explosive action redeems it for many 🔥🔥..

      The Raja Saab, starring Prabhas, is an upcoming Telugu horror-fantasy film
      by director Maruthi, set for a January 9, 2026 release, and early buzz
      highlights its grand scale, pan-India appeal, and Prabhas's mass
      entertainer vibe, with a recent song showing high energy, though trailer
      reactions suggest mixed feelings on heavy CGI and fantasy elements over
      pure horror.
